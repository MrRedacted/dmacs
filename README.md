# dmacs
it's actually a neovim config :)

Some notes:
  - Hack Nerd Font is recommended
  - Be sure to install the following:
    - lazygit
    - ripgrep
  - You may need to install tree-sitter, run checkhealth to see if tree-sitter needs installed
    - example would be libtree-sitter on Fedora
  - Run checkhealth within tmux to see what changes to .tmux.conf should be made, or download my awesome NeoMux configuration for tmux! (https://github.com/MrRedacted/NeoMux)
